        T-Echo magazine is ready with its third edition with a lot more interesting things. It will take you back to a memory lane of the outing, our enriched artists @Nikhil & @Mahima and most interestingly, how amazing Technovert is going to be in 2022 with the vision of our leadership. This time, it also has a special feature for a travel story by @Hitoishi motivating us to take a break now and then and an endearing inspiration from one of the fellow Technoverts @Mahender, we absolutely need today.
